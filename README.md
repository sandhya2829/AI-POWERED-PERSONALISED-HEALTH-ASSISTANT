# AI-POWERED-PERSONALISED-HEALTH-ASSISTANT

AI-Powered Health Assistant is an interactive web application developed using Django, Machine Learning, and Google's Gemini AI. The main objective of this project is to help users monitor their health by predicting their diabetes risk and providing personalized fitness and nutrition guidance. When a user logs in and submits their health details through a form — including inputs like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age — the app uses a pre-trained Decision Tree model to predict whether the user is at high or low risk for diabetes. Based on this risk and the provided health data, Gemini AI generates customized workout and diet plans tailored to the user.

The application includes a user-friendly dashboard with multiple tabs. The Home page displays a welcome message and a summary of the personalized plans. Users can view detailed diet and workout plans on their respective pages, each of which includes a chatbot powered by Gemini that responds to user queries related to health, diet, and fitness. The Exercise Search tab allows users to explore a list of common exercises with step-by-step instructions and images. Similarly, the Diet Search tab shows images and nutritional information for selected food items. The Progress tab displays a health chart comparing the user's input with standard diabetes levels using Chart.js and also provides useful health tips generated by Gemini.

User authentication is securely handled using Django’s built-in login and register system. Session-based data handling ensures a seamless personalized experience for each user. The ML model is integrated using pickle, and the Gemini API key is stored securely using a .env file. The frontend is built using clean HTML and Bootstrap for responsive design.

Overall, this project is a great example of integrating machine learning and AI in real-world healthcare applications. It not only predicts risk but also provides actionable, personalized solutions. The project is ideal for academic presentations, health tech demos, and future development into a full-scale health assistant platform.
